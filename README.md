# Unified Psychokinesis (PK) Model Development

Welcome to the Unified PK Model repository. This project aims to develop a robust, theoretically grounded model linking consciousness, quantum coherence, biophoton emissions, and environmental resonance to psychokinetic phenomena. The repository is organized into several key components:

- **Theoretical Framework:** Detailed in [mathematical_model.md](mathematical_model.md), this document provides the modelâ€™s equations, stability analysis, and phase plane insights.
- **Enhanced Simulation Code:** See [simulation_enhanced.py](simulation_enhanced.py) for Python code that simulates group dynamics with heterogeneous parameters, environmental resonance, and noise.
- **Stability Analysis Notebook:** The [stability_analysis.ipynb](stability_analysis.ipynb) notebook performs parameter sensitivity studies, phase plane analysis, and bifurcation exploration.
- **Experimental Protocols:** [experimental_protocols.md](experimental_protocols.md) outlines detailed experimental designs for testing the model in both individual and group settings.
- **Collaboration & Literature:** [collaboration_and_literature.md](collaboration_and_literature.md) provides an annotated bibliography and a roadmap for interdisciplinary collaboration.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** [interactive_dashboard.ipynb](interactive_dashboard.ipynb) demonstrates an interactive simulation dashboard for real-time parameter adjustment (using Jupyter Notebook widgets).

## How to Get Started

1. **Theoretical Background:**  
   Review [mathematical_model.md](mathematical_model.md) for the complete theoretical foundation.

2. **Simulations:**  
   - Run `simulation_enhanced.py` to simulate group dynamics.
   - Open `stability_analysis.ipynb` to explore parameter sensitivity and stability conditions.
   - Use `interactive_dashboard.ipynb` to interactively experiment with model parameters.

3. **Experimental Planning:**  
   Consult [experimental_protocols.md](experimental_protocols.md) for ideas on pilot experiments and detailed procedures.

4. **Collaboration:**  
   See [collaboration_and_literature.md](collaboration_and_literature.md) for a roadmap and literature references.
