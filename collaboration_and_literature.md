## Collaboration Roadmap

- **Interdisciplinary Teams:**  
  - Quantum physicists (for coherence and decoherence mechanisms).
  - Neuroscientists (EEG/MEG and neural synchronization).
  - Biophotonics experts (measurement and instrumentation).
  - Data scientists (simulation and analysis).

- **Collaboration Steps:**  
  1. Organize online seminars to discuss model assumptions and preliminary data.
  2. Form working groups for simulation, experimental design, and data analysis.
  3. Prepare joint grant proposals with clear milestones and deliverables.

- **Repository & Communication:**  
  - Use GitHub for version control and collaborative development.
  - Set up a mailing list or Slack channel for ongoing discussions.
  - Schedule regular meetings and updates to integrate experimental findings into the model.

## Future Directions

- Refinement of the model based on pilot experiment data.
- Expansion to include additional variables (e.g., emotional states, network topology).
- Development of an open-source interactive dashboard for real-time simulation and parameter tuning.
