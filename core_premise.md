Human consciousness may interact with the physical world by modulating electromagnetic fields, quantum processes, and biophoton emissions. This interaction is hypothesized to occur through mechanisms such as microtubule-based quantum coherence and the resonance alignment of biophotons. Factors like emotional states, environmental resonance, and collective intention may amplify these effects. These interactions form the theoretical foundation for psychokinetic (PK) phenomena, which seek to explain how human will or consciousness can influence physical systems.
