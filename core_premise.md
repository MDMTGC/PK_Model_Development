# Core Premise

The PK Model explores the potential interaction between human consciousness and the physical world through mechanisms such as:
- **Biophoton emissions** influencing neural communication.
- **Quantum coherence** in microtubules as a foundation for cognitive processes.
- **Feedback loops and resonance effects** stabilizing coherence.
- **Environmental factors**, such as Schumann resonance, affecting neural synchronization.

By integrating principles from quantum biology, neuroscience, and biophysics, the model seeks to establish a testable framework for psychokinetic phenomena.
