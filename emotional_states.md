Emotional Influence Insights:

Focused intention and meditation enhance biophoton emissions, while stress and anxiety suppress them.

Emotional regulation may play a critical role in optimizing quantum coherence and resonance alignment.

Hypothetical scenarios could include measuring biophoton emissions during meditation sessions compared to stressful activities to quantify emotional impacts on coherence.
