2. Environmental Resonance

Resonance alignment with natural frequencies (e.g., Schumann resonance) amplifies biophoton emissions:

: Resonance factor (0.6 to 1.5).

Environmental Resonance Insights:

Resonance at frequencies such as 7.83 Hz aligns with biological rhythms, enhancing coherence and biophoton emission intensity.

Experimental designs should focus on how specific resonance frequencies interact with microtubule coherence and neural activity.
