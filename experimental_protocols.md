# Experimental Protocols for the Unified PK Model

## Phase 1: Individual PK & Neural Coherence

### Objectives:
- Measure biophoton emissions and neural coherence during tasks requiring focused intention.
- Compare baseline states with PK task conditions.

### Methods:
- **Instrumentation:**  
  - High-sensitivity photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) or CCD cameras for biophoton detection.
  - EEG/MEG for recording neural oscillations.
- **Protocol:**  
  1. Baseline recording (resting state).
  2. PK task (e.g., guided meditation or directed concentration).
  3. Data synchronization and analysis of biophoton flux versus coherence.

### Data Analysis:
- Time-series analysis to correlate biophoton emissions with EEG coherence.
- Statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) to assess significant differences.

## Phase 2: Group Synchronization & Environmental Resonance

### Objectives:
- Investigate group-level coherence and the effect of environmental fields (e.g., Schumann resonance).

### Methods:
- **Setup:**  
  - Assemble groups (n > 50) in a controlled environment.
  - Simultaneously record group EEG and biophoton emissions.
- **Protocol:**  
  1. Baseline recording of group state.
  2. Guided group meditation or synchronized task.
  3. Introduce controlled electromagnetic stimuli to simulate enhanced Schumann resonance.
- **Data Analysis:**  
  - Evaluate group coherence (average of individual EEG data).
  - Compare with simulated predictions (using our model).

## Phase 3: Long-Term Stability & Feedback Enhancement

### Objectives:
- Assess the sustainability of induced high coherence states over extended periods.
- Evaluate the role of biofeedback in maintaining coherence.

### Methods:
- **Setup:**  
  - Extended monitoring sessions (hours to days).
  - Use biofeedback devices to provide real-time coherence levels to subjects.
- **Protocol:**  
  1. Baseline measurement.
  2. Continuous PK training with biofeedback.
  3. Periodic evaluation of coherence and biophoton emission levels.
- **Data Analysis:**  
  - Trend analysis over time.
  - Correlation of feedback signals with sustained high-coherence states.

## Safety & Controls:
- Ensure electromagnetic and optical measurements are within safe exposure limits.
- Use sham/control conditions to validate experimental effects.
