6. Feedback Loops with Noise and Temperature Dynamics

Iterative feedback loops reinforce emissions over time, influenced by resonance, quantum coherence, noise, and temperature dynamics:

: Emission intensity at iteration.

: Noise level at iteration, capped between 0.1 and 0.9:

Steady Noise: Constant noise level (e.g., 0.5).

Increasing Noise: .

Oscillating Noise: .

Feedback is capped to reflect biological and environmental constraints.

Feedback Loop Insights:

Oscillating noise aligns periodically with microtubule quantum coherence, stabilizing emissions while adapting to external fluctuations.

The role of pink noise (1/f noise), known for its prevalence in biological systems, could further optimize feedback stability.
