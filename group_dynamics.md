5. Group Dynamics

Group size amplifies collective coherence, with diminishing returns modeled logarithmically:

: Group size (number of synchronized individuals).

: Distance factor (meters, normalized).

Group Dynamics Insights:

Group synchronization quality, such as the alignment of mental states and intentions, significantly affects coherence amplification.

Monitoring group dynamics with EEG devices or other neural activity trackers could validate the model.

Theoretical plateaus occur around 50 individuals, where collective coherence saturates due to systemic limitations.
