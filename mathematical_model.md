# Mathematical Model for the Unified Psychokinesis (PK) Framework

## Introduction

This document outlines the mathematical foundation of the Unified PK Model. The model connects neural coherence, biophoton emission, quantum effects, and environmental resonance. The following sections detail the core equations, advanced stability analysis, and phase plane explorations.

## Core Equations

### Neural Coherence and Biophoton Emission

Let:
- \( C(t) \): Neural coherence (normalized between 0 and 1).
- \( B(t) \): Biophoton emission rate.
- \( E(t) \): Environmental resonance (e.g., Schumann resonance).

The basic equations are:

1. **Biophoton Emission:**
   \[
   B(t) = B_0 + \alpha \, C(t)
   \]
   - \(B_0\): Baseline biophoton emission.
   - \(\alpha\): Coefficient linking coherence to increased biophoton emission.

2. **Neural Coherence Dynamics:**
   \[
   \frac{dC}{dt} = k_1 \, B(t) \, (1 - C(t)) - k_2 \, C(t) + k_E \, E(t) \, (1 - C(t))
   \]
   - \(k_1\): Feedback coefficient for biophoton-induced reinforcement.
   - \(k_2\): Natural decay (e.g., neural fatigue).
   - \(k_E\): Environmental coupling strength.

### Group Dynamics

For a group of \( N \) individuals with individual coherence \( C_i(t) \):

\[
\frac{dC_i}{dt} = k_1 \, B_i(t) \, (1 - C_i(t)) - k_2 \, C_i(t) + k_{group} \, (\bar{C}(t) - C_i(t)) + k_E \, E(t) \, (1 - C_i(t))
\]
- \( \bar{C}(t) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} C_i(t) \) is the average group coherence.
- \( k_{group} \) quantifies the influence of the group on each individual.

## Advanced Theoretical Analysis

### Stability and Bifurcation Analysis

- **Fixed Points:**  
  Setting \(\frac{dC}{dt}=0\) leads to steady-state solutions. Analyze how fixed points vary with parameters \( k_1 \), \( k_2 \), and \( k_E \).

- **Bifurcation:**  
  Varying parameters (e.g., increasing \( k_E \) to simulate stronger environmental resonance) may cause bifurcationsâ€”transitions from a stable to an unstable state.

### Phase Plane Analysis

Plotting \( C(t) \) versus \( B(t) \) (or other combinations) reveals attractor states. For instance, consider:
- **Nullclines:**  
  Determine where \( \frac{dC}{dt}=0 \) and \( \frac{dB}{dt}=0 \) (if dynamic).
- **Trajectories:**  
  Numerical integration yields phase trajectories that help visualize how the system evolves toward a stable coherence state.

## Future Extensions

- **Include Emotional States:**  
  An additional variable \( \Theta(t) \) could represent emotional state, influencing both \( B(t) \) and \( C(t) \).
- **Network Topology:**  
  Extend to a network model where the coupling term \( k_{group} \) is replaced by a connectivity matrix, \( A_{ij} \), for more realistic interactions.

*This framework serves as the theoretical backbone for subsequent simulation and experimental work.*
