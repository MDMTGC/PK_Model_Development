3. Quantum Coherence

Quantum coherence enhances emission intensity through alignment at subatomic scales and the preservation of coherence over time:

: Quantum coherence factor (0.5 to 1.5).

: Coherence time (duration a system maintains quantum coherence, measured in seconds).

: Rate of decoherence caused by environmental noise (normalized, 0.2 to 1.0).

: Temperature effect, normalized as.

Quantum Coherence Insights:

Biological systems, such as photosynthesis and avian magnetoreception, rely on quantum coherence to optimize efficiency and function.

Microtubules within neurons sustain quantum coherence, enabling quantum computations and long-range signaling.

Quantum vibrations in microtubules, or superradiance, suggest their capacity to maintain quantum states in warm, noisy environments. This phenomenon is similar to quantum coherence observed in photosynthesis, where biological systems use quantum superposition to optimize energy transfer. In both cases, these systems demonstrate an ability to sustain quantum effects despite environmental noise, supporting their role in efficient biological functions.

Mechanisms to mitigate decoherence in microtubules may involve their fractal structure, molecular dynamics, and interaction with specific electromagnetic fields.

Anesthetic interactions with microtubules provide evidence for their role in consciousness, as these substances modulate quantum coherence.
